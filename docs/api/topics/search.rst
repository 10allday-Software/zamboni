.. _feature-profile-label:

Feature Profile Signatures
==========================

Feature profile signatures indicate what features a device supports or
does not support, so the search results can exclude apps that require
features your device doesn't provide.

The format of a signature is FEATURES.SIZE.VERSION, where FEATURES is
a bitfield in hexadecimal, SIZE is its length in bits as a decimal
number, and VERSION is a decimal number indicating the version of the
features table.

Each bit in the features bitfield represents the presence or absence
of a feature.

Feature table version 7:
