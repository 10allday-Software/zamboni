App Submission

How to submit an app
====================

Submitting an app involves a few steps. The client must be logged in for all
these steps and the user submitting the app must have accepted the `terms of use`_.

1. :ref:`Validate your app <validation-post-label>`. The validation will return
   a validation id.
2. :ref:`Post your app <app-post-label>` using the validation id.
   This will create an app and populate the data with the
   contents of the manifest. It will return the current app data.
3. :ref:`Update your app <app-put-label>`. Not everything that the Firefox
   Marketplace needs will be in the app, as the manifest does not
   contain all the data. Update the required fields.
4. :ref:`Create a screenshot <screenshot-post-label>`. For listing on the
   Firefox Marketplace, at least one screenshot is needed.
5. :ref:`Attach content ratings <content-ratings>`. All apps need content
   ratings before being reviewed.
6. :ref:`Ask for a review <enable-patch-label>`. All apps need to be reviewed,
   this will add it to the review queue.

    :type disabled_by_user: boolean

    **Response**

    :status 200: successfully completed.
    :status 400: something prevented the transition.


Key statuses are:

  * `incomplete`: incomplete
  * `pending`: pending, awaiting review
  * `public`: public and listed on listing pages and search results
  * `unlisted`: available only to those who know the URL and not listed on
    listing pages nor search results
  * `waiting`: waiting for the developer to publish, currently private and
    only visible to the developer and team members

Valid transitions that users can initiate are:

  * *incomplete* to *pending*: call this once your app has been completed and it
    will be added to the Marketplace review queue. This can only be called if all
    the required data is there. If not, you'll get an error containing the
    reason. For example:

    .. code-block:: json

        {
            "error_message": {
                "status": [
                    "You must provide a support email.",
                    "You must provide at least one device type.",
                    "You must provide at least one category.",
                    "You must upload at least one screenshot or video.",
                    "You must set up content ratings.",
                    "You must set up a payment account."
                ]
            }
        }

  * Once reviewed by the Marketplace review team, the app will be in one of the
    approved statuses ('public', 'waiting', or 'unlisted') and you can
    toggle between any of these statuses, e.g., *waiting* to *unlisted*.
  * *disabled_by_user*: by changing this value from `True` to `False` you can
    enable or disable an app.
